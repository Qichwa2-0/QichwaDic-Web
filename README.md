## About this project

This project aims to help Quechua speakers, students and people who need a tool to improve their Quechua 
vocabulary. This tool might help native speakers who want to recover forgotten words and meanings 
or who want to learn new words from other Quechua dialects.

This app was inspired by other tools like 
[SimiDic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketanolab.simidic&hl=en) 
and [Aulex](https://aulex.org/qu-es/).

Some features:

* Search criteria (starts with, ends with, exact, contains)
* User can get results even if the target word was not correctly spelled 
(for some common cases, e.g. ccello -> qillu).
* Retrieves results for different Quechua dialects by setting equivalent writings. 
For example, yachachi- / yaÄ‰achi- / yachatsi or qillu/q'illu
